<h1>PWM Controller</h1>
This project was created in an attempt to use 22V DC LED bars on a 12V DC source.
After locating the MeanWell LDB series of buck boost drivers, I decided I wanted to ad the capability to dim the LEDs, which the driver nicely allowed for. It requires a PWM signal input for dimming.

I decided that the use of a 555 timer was appropriate. I located a circuit that enables dimming from aprox 2%~98%.
The KiCad files are for the 555 timer PWM controller.
